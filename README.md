## Datasets

Preprocessed datasets are made available in [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aMIsi4qyBsFqeDbfwHUyE2JTEv06U1YO?usp=drive_link) due to their large file size. The original datasets are not uploaded to prevent any copyright issues. 
The dataset consists of the Korean Happiness Survey features with a correlation value of at least 0.1 corresponding to the happiness ladder and the 12 additional columns on environmental and socioeconomic factors. In total, we have 85 independent features that may contribute to the happiness ladder (i.e., life ladder).
